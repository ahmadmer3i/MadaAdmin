                    Mada Finance will follow the below procedure in financing and repayment of microloans against
                    goods or services requested by the client:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        o The interested client would discuss their needs and preferred payment scheme with MADA team
                        based on the needed items/services and duration of loan.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        o The client fills out an application form online/offline with the requested amount against an
                        item/service.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        o MADA team would collect documents and data. Once all documents are checked and everything is
                        in
                        order, MADA will provide the client with the total amount against the requested service/ item
                        including interest, and the payment schedule.
                    </li>

                        would
                        sign a bill of exchange or cheques to ensure payments covering the entire duration of the loan.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        o In case the total requested amount exceeds the client’s social security installment, a
                        co-signer/sponsor is required to cover the remaining value of the requested amount.
                    </li>
